# tl-mode

This is a dead-simple major mode for editing Teal programs in
emacs. The aim is for this to just bolt things on to
[`lua-mode`][luamode] and see how far I can get with that.


## Roadmap

 - [ ] Add all new keywords
 - [ ] Add support for typing syntax
 - [ ] Use tree-sitter for better syntax, perhaps


## Naming

[`teal-mode`][faketealmode] was already taken. boo.
